You have been provided one CSV file named "Object Detection.csv", from a total of four possible CSV files:

1. Object Location Change.csv
2. Object Detection.csv
3. Object State Change.csv
4. Object Counting.csv

## Purpose and Context

The objective is to generate natural and realistic questions aimed at benchmarking VLM abilities to understand and identify object associations, appearances, and disappearances within realistic office cubicle scenes between consecutive video episodes.

## Explanation of CSV Files

- Each CSV file represents changes observed between consecutive videos.
  - Object Location Change.csv: Tracks movements of objects between locations within the cubicle.
  - Object Detection.csv: Tracks the appearance or disappearance of unique objects within the cubicle.
  - Object State Change.csv: Captures state transitions (initial to final state) of objects.
  - Object Counting.csv: Documents quantity changes of non-unique objects within the cubicle.
- Changes accumulate progressively across episodes (video n-1 to video n).
- Videos referenced across CSV files for the same episode are identical.

## Explanation of Columns in "Object Detection.csv"

- Episode: Indicates the videos between which changes occur. Episode n is from video (n-1) to video n.
- Unique Object: Specifies the unique object that appeared or disappeared during the episode.
- Location inside Cubicle: Indicates the location of the unique object within the cubicle.
- Appear/ Disappear (Change): Indicates whether the object appeared or disappeared in the episode.

## Requirements for Generating Questions

Generate a JSON file containing questions based on every single recorded change within the provided CSV file. The JSON structure for each question must be as follows:

```json
{
    "Q1": {
        "Type": "Object Detection",
        "Change Number": 1,
        "Initial Video": 0,
        "Final Video": 1,
        "Question": "The question text",
        "Multiple Choice": {
            "A": "Possible Answer A",
            "B": "Possible Answer B",
            "C": "Possible Answer C",
            "D": "Possible Answer D",
            "E": "None of the above"
        },
        "Correct Choice": "A"
    }
}
```

## Detailed Instructions

1. Increment each question entry label sequentially (Q1, Q2, etc.).

2. Clearly specify "Type" from: Object Location Change, Object Detection, Object Counting, Object State Change. For the current CSV provided ("Object Detection.csv"), type is always "Object Detection".

3. "Change Number": Clearly corresponds to each row entry in the CSV for easy reference.

4. "Initial Video" and "Final Video": Always denote consecutive episodes (initial video i and final video i+1).

5. Provide exactly five multiple-choice options (A-E). Option E should be reserved for responses like "None of the above" or "All of the above," and should be correctly used occasionally to ensure difficulty.

6. False Answers (A-D):
   - Use only objects explicitly mentioned within the provided CSV file.
   - For other CSV types ("Object Location Change", "Object Detection", "Object State Change"), only use unique objects stated within their respective CSV files.

7. Do not explicitly state the video numbers within the question text itself.

8. If multiple changes occur within the same episode interval (e.g. 2 or 3 objects changed location), create multiple distinct questions ensuring each has only one correct answer.

9. Language and tone of the questions should feel conversational, natural, and realisticâ€”similar to how a human would genuinely query a VLM about scene changes. Avoid robotic or unnatural phrasing.

10. Difficulty Levels:
    - Level 1 (hardest): Do not mention the specific object or the change explicitly. Example:
      > "Did anything change in the cubicle between these episodes?"
    - Level 2 (medium): Specify the object explicitly, ask about the type of change. Example:
      > "There was a change in the number of steel mugs in the cubicle. What exactly changed?"
      > "The mouse in the cubicle has been touched, what happened to it?"
    - Level 3 (easiest): Clearly state the type of change and ask about the specific object. Example:
      > "An object's quantity increased between the episodes. Which object increased in number?"
    Ensure a balanced mix of difficulty levels unless otherwise instructed.

## Examples
1. Object Detection (Medium):
   > Question: "The Roman head statue disappeared from the cubicle. Where was it located before disappearing?"
   > Multiple Choice:
   > - A: On top of the PC
   > - B: In front of the left monitor
   > - C: Beside the red book
   > - D: On the desk
   > - E: None of the above

2. Object Detection (Easy):
   > Question: "A new object appeared on the desk. Which object appeared?"
   > Multiple Choice:
   > - A: Eiffel Tower toy
   > - B: Green triceratops toy
   > - C: Blue exploding kittens board game
   > - D: Butter cookies metal box
   > - E: None of the above

3. Object Detection (Hard):
   > Question: "Did anything appear or disappear between these episodes? If yes, what specifically changed?"
   > Multiple Choice:
   > - A: Eiffel Tower toy appeared; stapler disappeared
   > - B: Roman head statue disappeared
   > - C: Green triceratops toy appeared
   > - D: Butter cookies metal box disappeared; green triceratops toy appeared
   > - E: None of the above
